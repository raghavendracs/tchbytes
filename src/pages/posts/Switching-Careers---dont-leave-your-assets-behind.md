As people navigate through their careers in search of success and satisfaction, many a time driven by a multitude of factors they contemplate shifts in their career journey.

Irrespective of the fact if the planned shift is a small one (e.g. getting into a related role in the same company) or is a drastic one (e.g. changing completely from what you studied and did) it is key that such a switch is planned carefully.

Given the number of unknowns, planning for a change like this is a very difficult thing to do. In my personal experience, things get harder when (a) you have spent a lot of time in the current career path (b) you are thinking of reinventing yourself to play a completely different role.

I would strongly recommend that one of the first actions in planning would be spend time and discuss with people familiar with your thoughts / ideas on two aspects,

### **Change Factors**

The “why’s of the career switch” need to be captured in as honest a manner as possible. This is what gives you the motivation to go through the hardships of actually making the change and subsequently measure the level of impact that resulted on the factors you initially started off planning to change.

As you would start putting thought into this, it will soon become clear that there would be some degree of overlap in the factors that push people to think about switching careers. Based on my own personal experience and information gleaned from others I have spoken to points such as the following appear repeatedly as reasons why people contemplate a change.

*   Stuck in the same career position for many years
*   Going through the motions, but not really enjoying the work
*   Being a team manager means that I don’t get to do what I like, but manage people who are doing what I like.
*   Individual performers can pivot faster to changes in the market as opposed to Team Players
*   Moved away from what I like doing (Technology? Programming?), but keen to come back now.
*   My job does not pay me enough for the effort that I put in
*   Company does not appreciate the hard work I put into my job
*   ***And so on….***

### **Career Assets**

You surely need to probably learn a whole load of new things that your new career direction will demand. Given the change factors you are probably already motivated to start to burn the midnight oil on efforts in this direction.

But is the fear of wasting all the years you spent in your current career role bugging you ever so often ?

It is normal. The quicker you realize that a lot of strengths you have built and accumulated over the many years you have spent in your current role are things which you should actively take forward your mind will be more at ease.

While you go through the pain of learning new things, it is precisely these strengths that will give you the comfort and confidence that you are not starting off from scratch.

While you look back at the many years in your current role don’t concentrate on the good things. As Gerard Butler says in the movie Family Man (2017) to describe a senior candidate ***“He’s made all the mistakes a guy half his age hasn’t made yet, but will, and he’s learned from them all.”*** look critically at some of your failures and note what you learnt from that.

The list of your career assets will be a unique combination of your elements from your personal career journey so far.

Whenever you are stuck in your transition journey look what asset on your list you can use?

*   Is there a person you can call upon to help?
*   Is there a partner who might be able to give you a trial licence for a product?
*   Can somebody return a favor by giving you a pass for an event / conference?
*   If you are building something as a startup can somebody help you testing the product?
*   A supplier who might help you build a prototype?
*   ***… and so on***

Your ability to leverage these assets effectively would motivate you to keep moving ahead on your transition journey quickly and more effectively.

Make sure that you ensure that the list remain active — keep scaling it in every possible direction.

From my own personal journey in Sales over the last many years a few of the possible assets that would come in handy could be,

*   Relationships built in the market over time with technology partners, customers, suppliers, market influencers, advisors and so on…
*   Selling technology solutions in the market have helped build a good appreciation of what customers buy.
*   Market validation of any idea is key and getting that prospect / buyer viewpoint is relatively easy given the network.

As I was writing this article and speaking to people it became clear to me that the list of assets and ways to put that to use are extremely wide and vast. The deeper you go in each of the asset areas the more specific it becomes to you personal context. The more personal this list gets, the more value you can derive from this.

For some careers where I have limited visibility am keen to hear back to see what asset areas are present. I have designed a [**simple form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc16TxYaNW2idG7MCnz7g-iDR85-a-A3nbWLhWy-mFdzBtZsg/viewform) to gather some high level data on your career switch and also share what assets you feel will help you.

Will be grateful if you can contribute towards that exercise. All the data collected there would be presented back with as much of an analysis on possible.
