I have been studying the challenges that Seniors are facing today to adopt the barrage of new tech devices and services that are being made available to them.

Talking to seniors trying to get to grips to this burst of technology evokes a range of emotions — *some are excited, some feel pushed to a corner to adopt without any choice, some of them are frustrated that there is not support for them to learn new things****.***

The range of comments that you get to hear are extremely diverse, but am capturing a few that stood out for me.

> “I have so much equipment — a laptop, three tablets, an Echo Dot, an iPhone — I am overloaded with stuff. Do I really need all of this? Can’t I simplify things?”

> “Is difficult for me to start learning new stuff, particularly when I know that within 6 months the damn thing is outdated”

> “I find it interesting, but the advances come so rapidly it is hard to keep up and the cost of some of the devices is plain ridiculous.”

> “Finding time to learn to use and to fix technology is the biggest problem. I enjoy what technology can accomplish — more so, what others use to help me.”

> “Few years ago I was expected to simply learn and use whatever the younger generation wanted to use, but not anymore. There are a lot of products that are aimed towards people of my age — but challenge of learning still remains”

> “I am often frustrated by the complexity of technology and wish I didn’t need any of it!”

The list goes on, but one thing that is clear is that the ***Senior Generation of today are in a dilemma.***

They did not grow in the era of extreme growth of the internet, digital and the likes, but yet they depend on this technology ever more than before. There appear to be three broad categories in which technology is engulfing the seniors,

*   Communication and Entertainment
*   Health and Wellness
*   Safety, Security and Smart Homes Technologies

While they might have some choice in terms of adopting from a range of possibilities in some areas, the choice might be quite limited when you talk around Health, Wellness and Safety technologies.

To summarise the views of people that I spoke to,

> **Despite all challenges, the rise of technology has enhanced quality of life and given the possibility of leading an independent life much longer than what was possible earlier.**

> **Challenge is to learn and keep learning new things to ensure you are up to date — with limited structured support (more importantly for a 1–1 format) that exists today this is the hardest thing to overcome.**

Anybody adopting a new technology or service would typically go through the following 6 phases in an iterative manner.

*   Choose the “right fit” technology
*   Procure the device / service
*   Install, Setup and Configure the device / service
*   Learn to Use the device / service
*   Upgrade or Re-configure when needed
*   Repair / Replace as needed

While you might think these phases are common place, seniors face a challenge in almost each of these phases driven by the following challenges.

#### Managing Choice of Technology and Speed at which it changes

The younger generation want “choice” and sometime “excessive choice” in everything thing they want to adopt. They are not fazed by this and are happy to have it.

Seniors however clearly are not at the same level of digital literacy and would be happier to have an easier path to decide what device / service to adopt.

Some of the examples that I came across when seniors are trying to identify what suits them,

> Lot more harder to decide if a touch interface is better or a voice interface is better or good old keyboard is better.

> Can I have a simple device to access the online things I want to access? My phone is too complex and there are a 100 apps for doing anything?

> My grand daughter teaches me a lot of things, but I keep forgetting it. I am too old to write, what options do I have? About a 1000 note taking applications with 100’s of features. Do I want all of that?

#### **Wide Range of Asks from Technology, but clarity of thought**

One of the first mistakes that I did when I started approaching this topic was to assume that the younger seniors would be keen to learn and interest to learn new things would go down as people advance in age.

***Boy was I wrong !!!***

I found people in their early 90’s keen to catch anything that was thrown at them and were trying to get Alexa to respond to their voice. I also found people in their 60’s not even wanting to make an online transfer on their laptop as it was too much of a change.

So essentially like any other group of consumers, the range of asks that Seniors expect are diverse too.

***“But amidst this diversity was immense clarity on what they did not want to learn”***

For example one senior in her 70’s that I spoke to said,

> “I want to take photos on my mobile, print it using Wifi on my printer and get it on my scrapbook that I am building as a legacy for my grand kids”

> “I only want to see what my children post on Facebook. I will tell them how I feel about those photos when I speak to them. Doing it on Facebook is too impersonal”

> “I dont want a tablet as I can’t manage more than one device.”

This was not unique to a small group of people — I tried asking most of the seniors that I spoke to if they can list Top 3 things they wanted from Technology and it was damn easy for them.

Targeting this would make it much easier for seniors to get tutored and ramp up faster.

#### **Technology is Costly, looking at it as an “investment”**

While it is clear that seniors have a lot of surplus income in many cases, are they happy to part away £1000 for a smartphone or tablet. Without some tough discussions and push back – a definite no !!

Why might that be the case?

*   A lot of the functionality on devices and services targeted towards the younger generation is “useless” for them.
*   Value associated with a device or service is not the same as what a younger person would do.
*   Given the rate of change that is happening is my investment really for the long run? What if the device gets super seeded with something else?

There are a number of companies that are trying to address this problem by creating products dedicated for the seniors with limited and necessary functionality.

#### **Learning Technology is Hard**

As I was summarising in my conversations above, even for the enthusiastic seniors the thing that trips them over is the feeling that learning technology is hard. Addressing this is probable one of the most important elements.

There are probably three things to keep in mind when helping seniors onboard on to a technology / service.

**Piggyback on their Interests**

Don’t go with what you think is important for the elders. You are not them, and more over they usually know what they want.

Is staying connected with friends, grandchildren and other family members important for them? Do they like sharing photos with family? Do they like reading books on the internet? Are they religious and want to follow that on the net? Are they wanting to be independent by using one of the 100’s of on-demand services?

List go on and on — but, surprisingly seniors have an excellent clarity of thought in terms of what they want to pick up technology for. Just work with them to understand their needs and it would be easy to just piggyback on their interests.

> Technology always opens doors irrespective of which one you start with.

**Focus on Simplicity**

Given the amount of options and features that are there with new devices it can be daunting for the younger generation to use. Couple this with the fact that many seniors might not just have the same level of digital literacy this would only make things harder for them.

Given the popularity of some of the smartphones and tablets, it is probably more likely that seniors would have that rather than something that might be simpler and designed for them.

For anybody who is aiming to help seniors learn a device / technology, It’s important to be patient and to avoid making assumptions about what might be important to them.

As long as you are keeping things simple and focusing on something they want to learn things would go faster and smoother.

> Simplicity and Patience can do wonders for both you and the senior.

**Demonstrate Value in adopting Technologies**

As our elderly loved ones age, their level of independence can often start to dwindle. This can be frustrating, causing them feel more dependent on their families for everyday needs. Thankfully advances in technologies and the overall on-demand economy for almost all day to day convenience items is making things a lot easier.

Seniors are the ultimate “value buyers” so keep that in mind to let them buy into learning the technology as well.

*   Gaining independence at that age is a very important driver and showing how adopting a particular technology can help immensely.
*   Adopting new digital habits may not happen overnight or all at once, but empowering your family member to feel capable using any new device, app or process is a step in the right direction.
*   Safety and Security is a big concern at that age. Make sure that you keep this in focus and try to allay their fears in as simple a manner as possible.

> Demonstrating Value in every conversation is critical

#### Conclusion

To summarise let me put down a few simple points,

*   Seniors are a diverse group of people with differing asks. Appreciate that and ask what they want to achieve before enforcing anything. They may not know technology but most certainly know why they want to learn.
*   Find it harder to go through a technology on boarding cycle – choose, procure, setup, learn, repair, upgrade, replace.
*   Build Trust, Keep it simple, Focus on Cost / Value in every engagement.
*   Simplify learning by focusing on 1–1 engagement and target it to their needs. Learning Technology for Seniors might have simple end goals.

Keen to hear views and feedback.
