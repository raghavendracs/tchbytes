Have you had a recent trigger and interest in writing and sharing your learnings and experiences with others? As they usually say,

> **“A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” *(Lao Tzu)***

Medium is probably an excellent platforms where content holds center stage. I chose this as my platform to write, but most of what I am writing is true whatever your platform to write might be.

Taking a guess on your situation, there is a high probability that “writing” itself is not new or alien to you,

*   *you have been writing course assignments, submissions and the like all through your college life.*
*   *you probably went on to craft proposals and documents in your professional life,*
*   *probably have written 100’s or may be even 1000’s of emails to explain a range of topics to colleagues, managers, partners.*

Naturally you feel confident and are raring to go.

***….you list down ideas, churn out drafts, keep it stuck there for sometime and one fine day decide to put it out into the open…***

***Congratulations you have got aboard the hype cycle.***

As most of us who start off writing, dont expect anything easy. It is hard to get your content noticed and earn the expected engagement and feedback from readers to keep you going.

It is all about thinking creatively, trying and trying again until you feel you are getting the right level of engagement from readers.

> “To learn something new, you need to try new things and not be afraid to be wrong.” (**Roy T. Bennett)**

Each person’s journey is unique and brings about lessons and learnings which are unique. I have to capture my important observations as I struggle on this journey. Hope it encourages you to remain motivated.

#### Needing to Read vs. Choosing to Read

In most cases all the content you have written thus far, to your teachers at college, to customers in a proposal, to teams in emails, are mostly to communicate your analysis of something you should showcase as having understood.

You write content and the reader makes an effort to understand what you are trying to say and implicitly or explicitly rates your content. In most cases (barring a few literary streams of study) you were being assessed for correctness of content, quality of analysis and clarity of thought.

***Switch over now to a platform like Medium and think about your experiences here….***

First and foremost, people here **choose to read** (or should we say mostly skim) content they want to. And if you are lucky enough to hold on to their interest they might choose to engage further. A much smaller percentage of users might be excited to clap or leave a response.

Appreciating this key difference alone motivates you to keep writing even when you see a pretty drab dashboard. It takes a few articles (it might be your 8th or somebody else’s 25th article!) to click and get you the engagement you are looking for.

Even after this bump in engagement, dont expect miracles — people “choose to read” what they find useful.

#### Narrative and Experience Led Content

In all writing thus far, be in at school, university, or in professional life narrative and experience led content is probably not the primary form of writing. Expectations is to keep your content sharp and somewhat formal.

From what my personal experience when engaging with content on Medium and similar platforms, I tend to tilt towards content that is more narrative and experience led as opposed to ones that are purely factual.

Transitioning to a narrative, experience led style of writing is not that difficult once you get the hang of it, but honestly it did take me a bit of unlearning. But as I have progressed from my 1st to the 15th article I am hoping that there is a perceptible change — personally for me there definitely appears as there is.

#### Structuring Content effectively

Readers “choose to read content they find interesting” and are probably looking for a “narrative and experience led” style of writing to engage with.

Despite all this there is no downplaying the fact that structuring content effectively is something you can’t pay enough importance to.

At this point a quote from Stephen King really stood out for me,

> “You can’t please all of the readers all of the time, you can’t even please some of the readers all the time, but you really ought to try to please some of the readers some of the time” — Stephen King

So what are three elements that I think are important to keep in mind as you structure content to hopefully appeal to some readers some of the time.

**Define you ideal reader**

Anybody who views your article is asking one question and only one question — Is this content for them? Will it help them?

I think it is best to provide an answer to this immediately. Starting by giving a clear indication of whom this article is targeted for is super useful— take your pick of where you want to do this ? Keep it in the title, focus on it in the first line or feel free to take two paragraphs to set the context.

This out of the way, a click with the right user is established and will encourage the right reader to go further.

I also feel that it is human nature for people to do something that is told as explicitly not for them. People who are probably not your “reader type” also go ahead with the pure intention of challenging your thoughts. This is absolutely great — writing should progress your own thinking as well and what better way than some debate.

**Visualize Questions**

Readers always have questions popping and thoughts rolling as they go through your content.

You obviously can’t imagine or expect all of them, but there are questions you have yourself as you write the article. Remember that an article is as much for progressing your own understanding and thinking on the subject you are writing on as much as is for others who are reading it.

Visualize as many questions as you can in the flow of the content. This keeps users engaged as then progress through reading.

This also structures content better and gives hooks to people who are skimming through content to latch on. Readers might pretty well drop off after a few paragraphs only to latch back on seeing a interesting question towards the end.

#### In Summary

Being a successful content creator is hard work and needs patience and commitment. Hopefully the points above gave you some confidence to travel past the trough of disillusionment.

> **Users choose to read content they find interesting — onus is on you to make it easier for them to choose. It is hard and keep up the commitment to generate content regularly.**

> **Keeping your content narrative and experience led makes it easier for users to relate and engage. People want to hear your story as is and want to make their conclusions.**

> **Read and re-read your drafts to make sure that your content is structured. Nobody wants to have their time wasted in reading haphazard content — Start by defining who your ideal reader is and visualize questions they might have as they go through you content.**

**All the best ! Keep Writing…**
