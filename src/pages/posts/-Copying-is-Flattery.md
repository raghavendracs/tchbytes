**“Copying is Flattery”**

*   Copying the theme or train of thought itself does not sum up to me as flattery. Afterall, everybody is inspired by what they have read somewhere or experience somewhere. It is a personal spin that makes it different.
*   Copying the exact content that I have written partially or fully does not amount to flattery either for me. Copying parts of what I have written definitely demands a credit somewhere in the copy and that is rather basic to expect.
