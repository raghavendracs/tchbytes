In the last few years, every Tech Company runs its own "tech conference" usually on an annual basis to share their thinking and provide a platform for its community to rally behind their products.

Conferences are definitely getting bigger as each year progresses and clearly there is a lot of value to be derived from these. From a participants view, I think the following three benefit points stand out.

> - Gives a good view of the direction the products and companies are taking
> - Opportunity to meet people who are working in similar technologies and solutions
> - Hear from the "early adopters" on innovative ways of using the solutions

Am sure there are enough and more articles which talk about the benefits of attending tech conferences (provided you can afford them !), but would it be fair to say it is all positive - **probably not !!**

**I have consciously decided not to add to the list of great things to be gained by attending these conferences**.

But what I will do instead is to look at the **3 areas that one needs to be wary of while attending these conferences**.

Keep attending the conferences, but just keep in mind the point below to have a even more successful and fulfilling experience.

## All that glitters is not gold

In today's fast paced rate of change, the #1 thing that product companies focus in conferences is a long list of **new features** they have brought to the market in the last 9-12 months.

While as a technical innovator, having a continuously evolving product landscape at your disposal is excellent news, to remain close to the end user problem you are trying to solve will always remain more important.

A tech conference offers an excellent platform to upgrade your knowledge and is not something that is to be missed.

However, my only submission is that developers should build their quiver of solutions but only adopt something if it makes the **developer experience or user experience** better.

I have seen a number of tools and solutions getting adopted into production projects without the right level of validation after a set of team members visit a conference and learn about something. 2 or 3 sprints get allocated to technical refactoring of code to do things differently. **Visible end user change is forgotten and this is in my view is counter productive.**

As has always been the case in the word of technology, there is merit in sometimes **not adopting** the latest solutions, but wait until the end use use case demands it.

> **_Take in every new technology, solution, approach that you hear but spend the time to analyze them before adopting them in your products._**

## Feeling that you always catching up

If you have been attending conferences for sometime now, let me ask you a simple question. **Look back and try to evaluate how you feel after you have come back from the conference?**

> 1.  Super happy that there is a lot of new things that you did not know about
> 2.  Happy at having heard other company speakers talk about how they are ahead of you
> 3.  Feeling **tired** with the load of new things that you need to pick up now
> 4.  Worried about the **amount of refactoring** you now need to go back and do in your projects?
> 5.  All of the above

I am reasonably sure that you carefully read options 1-4 and ended up marking 5.

For me personally, there is a rush of adrenelin when listening to all the newest and greatest things at a conference, but my productivity falls when i am back.

**_Why do I think this might be the case?_**

> - You end up spending a lot of time reading and re-reading about new stuff they have listened to.
> - In many cases these concepts might not be directly be applicable to the project they are working on, but there is a tendency to try and force fit atleast some of it. Inevitable urge to have "all that glitters" in your project.
> - Feeling demotivated as a result of the realization of what you know vs. what is new.

If you are feeling this way I think it is key to realize that this is normal and be prepared to have a plan to deal with it - **Rome was not built in a day**.

Take your time to assimilate all what you have heard and dont rush to make any assumptions that all or any of it is immediately applicable in your project.

Knowledge is far more powerful when you know where and when to apply it
