I think most of the points that you have laid out are probably true. Only question I have is would this all work immediately effectively if you get into a new team without ever meeting them?

I would tend to argue that you need to spend some time with the team you are working with before switching over to a “remote work” approach.

Having a connect with your team can actually make remote work even more effective and efficient.
