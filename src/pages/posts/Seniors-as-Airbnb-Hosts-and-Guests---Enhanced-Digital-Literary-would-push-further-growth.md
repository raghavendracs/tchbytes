Have been doing some reading recently around challenges and opportunities to support the elders community.

I came across an [article](https://ipropertymanagement.com/airbnb-statistics/) today which summarizes a lot of statistics around Airbnb.

I will focus on writing this article in an Airbnb specific manner, but trust the key messages would apply for other platforms where short term letting does take place.

The one important thing that stood out for me was the question,

> **How many hosts does Airbnb have worldwide?**

> **Airbnb has about 650,000 hosts across the globe. Currently, the fastest-growing Airbnb host demographic is seniors, with over 200,00 senior hosts on the site. Over 120,000 of these hosts are senior women. Senior women also tend to be the most highly-rated host group.**

In my personal understanding based on close observations of my parents who went through a similar situation recently, two important perceived advantages could be driving this growth.

#### Keeping their Long Term Home — Commercially Viable and Flexible

One of the most common approach that a number of seniors adopt post retirement with regard to their hosting is to “rightsize” their homes. Many of them seem to view this as the only alternative and take this option reluctantly.

Speak to anybody and this transition is not easy by any means — planning for it is hard, and actually adjusting to it is much harder.

Drivers for this might be varied — for some it might be the inability to keep the home commercially viable, while for others it might the constraints to manage it physically.

What ever be the reason, most seniors if given an option, like to prolong their stay in their long term homes for as long as it is feasible. Afterall they are emotionally attached to the house, have a number of memories in it, community around it and a range of aspects that one cannot easily capture in words.

**So is there a viable option to this “rightsizing”?**

According to report [here](https://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/housing/info-2016/home-sharing-report.html) it appears that seniors are giving a big thumbs up to options such as Airbnb Hosting.

> The average Airbnb host age-65+ earns $8,350 in supplemental income annually for a single property.

> Nearly 60 percent of older adults report that income from Airbnb hosting has helped them stay in their homes, 13 percent report that hosting has helped them avoid foreclosure, 35 percent said hosting helped them avoid eviction.

Taking that route appears to give them with an alternative to rightsizing.

*   Offers Tax Advantages (short term lets) in most countries and contributes substantially towards making things Commercially Viable to continue on the long term home.
*   Allows to Keep things Flexible — for example block off dates when you know your children / grandchildren are coming to visit.

#### Remain Active, Keep a Positive Outlook and Connected

While commercial viability is a key advantage, the possibility to continue in the long term home offers seniors with a great option to continue in a zone of familiarity.

This can make things highly comfortable for seniors and avoid the stress of adjusting to a new environment from scratch. My parents took a number of years to agree to the fact that they needed to rightsize. I would say the lack of an alternative was one of the key factors that drove them to take a long time.

> More than 60 percent of older adults report that hosting has positively changed the way they think, and 45 percent say hosting has positively affected the way they interact with their community.

Seniors usually are flexible, understanding, calm, patient and have many of the attributes to make a great host. Having said this, the transition into a host offers them a number of advantages as well.

*   Being a Host had a certain structure and regimen and if you are somebody who has been working for 20 / 30 years being able to continue it in a different setting is a great blessing.
*   It offers seniors the possibility to socialize, meet new people and create unique [experiences](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/s/experiences?af=&c=.pi0.pk56776472805_289333030269_c_303480525523&sem_position=1t1&sem_target=aud-497685986534%3Akwd-303480525523&location_of_interest=&location_physical=9046034&gclid=CjwKCAjwtuLrBRAlEiwAPVcZBn3fFojIz4XMtTo165741qzFLYGtn2AMWCH8IH8-I2Ivr4hVmLStjBoCI9YQAvD_BwE&_set_bev_on_new_domain=1568208502_lxNzwP0zSWCg8rgh) for their guests. At a time when potentially your children and grandchildren are not around you that often this can be a great morale booster.
*   At a time when Seniors are travelling more than ever before, connecting wtih people from different places gives them the motivation and interest to explore new things.
*   In a digitally connected world of today, being a host gives the seniors a chance to connect with people as well to some extent outside the extreme digital focus.

It is clear that the 60+ age group is looking at hosting guests on platforms such as Airbnb and probably many others. At the same time, fact that the same age group has a lot more disposable income and time means that they are also travelling much more. They are being guests at any number of locations with examples like [Debbie and Michael](http://bbc.com/worklife/article/20181127-the-senior-nomads-who-sold-everything-to-travel-the-world) at the extreme end.

*It would be safe to say that seniors are pushing both the host and guests side of the equation on platforms such as Airbnb.*

**But…**

***60% of guests on Airbnb are millenials and them adjusting to a Senior Host seamlessly or the other way round with Senior Guests getting the acceptance with the 50%+ of the younger hosts is far from smooth.***

Getting this alignment better hinges critically on understanding the key reasons why the gap exists in the first place. Again from the number of conversations with Seniors that I have been having over the last months I think there are two main aspects that need bridging.

#### Role of Technology has Grown Exponentially

<figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@ugmonk?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@ugmonk?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Jeff Sheldon</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption>

Companies of today are born in the digital era and hence automatically lean a lot on Technology for any number of aspects in this letting process. A few of the ones that stand out are,

*   Listing and Searching for Options
*   Guests and Hosts Engaging wtih each other — communicating about the property, handling payments and refunds
*   Homes are expected to get Smarter as we go ahead — Smart TV’s, Safety and Security around the house will only increase we go.

To ensure that Seniors are able to engage effectively on these new age Digital Platforms and Technology Devices they need to onboard themselves on it. It might appear easy to millenials, but given the rate at which Technology evolves this is not a simple ask on the Seniors.

Any time a senior guest is engaging with a younger host or vice versa this gap might become more visible and cause unexpected challenges.

#### High Levels of Digital Literacy Expected

Across the overall experience of booking and utilizing the platform if there is one thing that is expected as a default is a enhanced level of digital literacy. While for a younger person / millennial this is easy, but for a senior guest or host it can be quite frightening.

As an example, with the growth of the on-demand, consumption led economy feedback / ratings systems have gained a tremendous amount of importance. Users always decide to a large extent based on what others are thinking about the product or service.

As summarized [here](https://www.reviewtrackers.com/social-proof/),

> The term was first coined by Robert Cialdini in *Influence*, social proof (sometimes called informational social influence) is often described as a psychological and social phenomenon in which people assume the actions of others in order to best reflect what is considered correct behavior for any given situation.

> We’ve traditionally turned to a variety of useful sources as social proof. These include credible experts, thought leaders, celebrities and influencers, friends, and the wisdom of the crowd — all of whom, in one situation or another, can influence people’s decisions on how to behave.

While the Senior Generation is well accustomed to have credible experts, thought leaders, friends, celebrities etc helping shape opinion the digitization of all of this and managing it is the new bit that is sometimes not easy for them to understand.

*   Seniors are lax at leaving feedback, more so online (tied to the fact that everything happens in the digital context)
*   Seniors might be different in their thinking of what constitutes a good / bad feedback.
*   Seniors are overcome by concerns on security in many cases when information exchange needs to happen

#### Way forward

So clearly while the importance of seniors both as guests and hosts on Airbnb is increasing, it is clear that they would need some hand holding.

1.  Matching asks of guests and hosts better — enabling guests choose better listings and hosts to choose the right guest.
2.  Enabling easier on-boarding on technologies via a helpline, 1–1 training, training videos, Group Sessions, Train the Trainer
3.  Enable connect with other hosts and guests in the same situation as yours.
