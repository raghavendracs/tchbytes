Have been working remotely (although not for 5 days a week) for quite a long time now. I should definitely say that I tend to agree with all your suggestions.

If you have the opportunity to connect with the team you work with, I have found that do be greatly enriching to me personally. Would encourage everybody who can do that to do it.
