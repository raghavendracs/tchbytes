Are you thinking of reinventing your career? Are you spending most of your time looking at communities and groups where you can more perspectives on the pros and cons of embarking on this change.

Good ! Afterall the change journey is bound to get lonely at times, particularly at 1 AM when you have been grappling with something for the last 36 hours !

Having a community / support system to help you can be a great advantage, and all time you invest in building / exploiting one is something that will never go waste.

The #1 item when you are looking at a community is to look for learnings / observations / suggestions from people who have been through a similar journey as the one you are on. You would usually find them across three broad categories,

*   ***People who have crossed this journey successfully and made the transition*** — these people make everything look **optimistic** and appear that they knew exactly what do to when. Mistakes in their journey typically appear as footnotes, which you would tempted to ignore in the big scheme of things.
*   ***People who embarked on this journey but gave it up completely and moved back to what they were doing earlier*** — these people make things look **pessimistic**. Typically 80% of their articles are talking about how and why such a journey is insurmountable with successes sprinkled in between.
*   ***People who started a career journey but evolved along the way*** — articles written by people who fall in this category offer a **realistic** view of the journey. Reinventing your career is a long journey and a lot can change and it is key to be prepared to evolve your destination as well.

Each of the three groups give you a very different perspectives of how they have approached and managed the journey to reinvent their careers. All of it is important and is key you assimilate each of these viewpoints.

Remember that your career journey is unique. It is your specific situation, your personality type, way in which you visualize your end goal among a slew of other factors that leads you to lean towards learnings of one group more than the other.

> “Everything we read and hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is perspective, not unchangeable truth”

Whatever you have picked up as learnings / observations / suggestions from your reading the journey’s of others — remember it is only their perspective. Unless you adapt it to your context, value you can extract from it is minimal.

The best way in my way is to get into a “conversation” with people who have shared their journeys to get their contribution in adapting their perspectives to you context.

While you are reasonably confident that such a conversation will add value to you in your journey, you are doubtful why anybody would engage in a dialogue.

Honestly, unless you have answered this question in your mind, you will not do justice to the dialogue and only extract sub-optimal output from that.

Getting people to initiate a dialogue with you is not easy, but let me offer a few suggestions on hooks you can use to trigger a conversation and sustain interest.

#### “Optimists”

Remember these are the people who have been successful in making a career change — so naturally focus on positives.

Your hook to engage with them is to explore the following,

*   Situations which they feel supported the success
*   Unique things they tried to taste success
*   Willingness to mentor you to make the change yourself
*   Call upon their support to get a job once you have actually made the journey — they are in the best position to help you.
*   Talk about mistakes — but again from a perspective of how they managed to catch it early.

#### “**Pessimists**”

Remember these are the people who have not been successful in making the change and gone back to what they were doing.

Your hook to engage with them is to explore the following,

*   Situations that worked against them making the change
*   Key challenges that they could not overcome and things they might have done differently
*   Thoughts if the career path they chose to reinvent was the issue or was it their approach that failed them?
*   How have they managed to get back to their initial careers — nobody manages failure easily, so any lessons here would be always helpful to have.

#### “Realists”

These are the people who consider themselves successful even when they reached point C, despite have started to go from A to B.

Your hooks to engage with them is to explore the following,

*   What were the triggers that led to them change destination? Did it happen gradually?
*   People sometimes consider inability to reach where they set out to reach as a failure — do they see it as such or as success?
*   Get a feel for how the evolution of destination happen? Was it learnings along the journey? Or was it situation that changed externally?

#### Engaging with the community

As you continue on your journey to reinvent your career, it is imperative that you engage with communities effectively. Hopefully the above article has given your a summary perspective of three things,

*   Engage with all 3 categories of people — have made the change successfully, have failed to make the transition, evolved as they travelled on the career change journey
*   A dialogue is always better than a one way reading / hearing of experiences / learnings / observations / suggestions.
*   Evoking interest in people to engage in a 2 way dialogue is not easy. You extract maximum value when you engage and hopefully some of the hooks I have shared would help your trigger conversations.

Community engagement is useful but remember the person undertaking the journey is YOU — I know it is a difficult journey and hope this makes it a little easier for you.

All the best !
