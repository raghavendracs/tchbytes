Have you started to move into a journey in getting into programming with the objective to land a job in coding?

The initial suggestions that almost everybody probably will tell you are,

*   *Structure your learning*
*   *Make intelligent choices on what area of programming you want to focus*
*   *Approach to make learning effective*
*   *Work as a team*
*   *and so on…*

Yes definitely all this is critical — but it is probably super important to realize that at the end of this journey you will be looking for a job in a scenario where the entire hiring process is undergoing extreme change.

Actively prepare for this change as a key strand in your learning journey.

*In the past getting hired for a job was broadly on the following lines…*

*   Start Learning the domain or technology that you want to concentrate on (e.g. Web Development, UI/UX Design, Database Administrator etc.)
*   Put your head down and concentrate on learning. Somewhere a little later, towards the end of this journey, say after 4–6 months of learning, you start thinking of what to highlight in your resume.
*   Put together a resume — shortlist a set of companies and roles to target — look to send it off to them and await feedback.
*   Hiring manager looks at your CV, which let us say, he likes, calls you for a few rounds of discussion and fingers crossed — voila ! you have the job at the end of it.

Having looked at the hiring process in some detail over the last months and years (was my [startup idea](http://reinvent) for learning technology), I can tell with some level of certainty each step of the process above is changing and changing drastically.

Learning has become community (=team) effort which simply means that most candidates have a lot more content in their distributed digital portfolio than any resume / interview can ever capture. This is partly as producers of content and partly as consumers of content.

Content typically is distributed across *articles, posts, stack overflow answers, Github repositories, Open source contributions and so on…* which means that if you dont build one as well across in parallel with your learning process, you probably have ZERO chance of standing out in the hiring process.

As a candidate, the number one thing you need to do is very simply —

> **“Start thinking much earlier about building up your portfolio of contributions in the digital realm to effectively represent your learning journey.”**

While this looks logical, I have heard so many developers (including myself) putting this off using any number of excuses

> “Let me learn this one thing and then will start contributing on Stack Exchange”

> “There are people who know much more than me. Let me just consume the answers and not worry about it any more”

> “There is simply too much content already. Adding to it will make it harder for newbie’s like me to look for answers”

> and so on…

Just remember — asking seemingly silly questions or making mistakes in answering questions is simpler as a beginner than when you want others to see you as an expert.

Let me spend next few paragraphs on a couple of possible areas to start…

#### Open Source Contributions

Are you using an open source package? I am assuming that 99.9% of the time the answer is “yes”.

In that case this is probably best place to start,

*   Make a list of all packages you are using (package.json in a React context for example)
*   Prioritize the list in order of importance to your project. Remember this is your assessment for your project.
*   Start looking from the top for a possible project to get engaged into.

Start at the top of the list and do this package by package — at least for the top 3–5 packages.

1.  See if you can answer questions that other new users of that package are asking?
2.  See if there are simple PR’s which the community is expecting?
3.  Did you spend a lot of time on solving a particular problem (even if you used answers that were already there)? If yes, can you make an effort in explaining the problem and solution to save some time for others who have the same problem after you?
4.  Contribute to the feature set for next release on that package?

While doing any of these might appear like a burden when you actually are doing it, be rest assured these are like good deeds which will come back to help you at a later stage.

#### Learn, but also create content around it

Until very recently, I was focused on learning from what others have written across a number of platforms. But I think it is absolutely key to balance learning with creating content about that learning.

Personally, I was grappling with the feeling *“Do I know enough to write about things that I am learning”* for a long time.

This is probably a natural feeling, but can assure you it is something that you can’t overcome unless you start writing about your learnings. The more you capture your learnings in content (articles, posts, videos, code snippets etc.) the quicker your learning will be. Your retention shoots through the roof and you will think yourself for having done this.

As a parallel, one of the biggest fears (at least for me initially) was to open a blank file and start writing some code. So many of the things you think you know simply desert you and you fall back on code snippets 8/10 times.

You know as a developer this is a must break fear and you keep at it and soon break it. Writing about what your are learning is akin to this, it needs to be overcome and with a little perseverance and you can get it done.

#### Final Thoughts

I have just given a couple of areas as examples, but where you start does not really matter much. Like many other things, doing (any)one of these things will set off a virtuous cycle and will soon become part of your learning pattern and rigor.

Am pretty confident that a lot of what I have written is not new to you, but the hard part is actually doing it. It took me many months before I could start, but I hope this article has give you a little nudge to start sooner.

Looking forward to hear your next steps…
