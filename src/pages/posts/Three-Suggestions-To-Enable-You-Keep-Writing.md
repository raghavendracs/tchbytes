I started writing on Medium a few months ago and the experience has been a enriching one. Things have been on a roller coaster in terms of confidence to write, topics to write on, user engagement, but there have been a load of learnings already.

While I am writing for my Publication [Career Reinvent](https://medium.com/career-reinvent), the other key focus area for me has been to better at writing. As part of that, I have been following a number of publications (one that I have been reading a lot being [The Writing Cooperative](https://writingcooperative.com/)) which aim at helping people write and write efficiently and effectively.

A lot of the topics around [writer’s block](https://writingcooperative.com/search?q=writers%20block), getting creative, keep ideas flowing have been written on quite extensively. These are very important challenges, and getting solutions to these challenges is predicated for me on ***three simple ideas***.

#### If you only write about “***what you know***” or “***what you think about***” you cannot go very far

Most of us start writing about what we know and what we believe in. Needless to say almost everybody is comfortable with writing freely about what they have been learning, what they have experienced.

***How far can you go with this approach? Is this the right one?***

Depending on you depth, breadth of understanding and writing skills you can possibly go 20, 30 or may be 100 articles. This will give you a great start, but is it something you can do for years together — probably not.

Most people write for one or more of the following reasons,

*   Want to share what they know with others
*   Engage with readers and hopefully make money by writing
*   Feel that writing gives them comfort and happiness
*   Writing as a way to more effectively learn new topics
*   Writing to document things they know and things you learn

As you can see rather easily a lot of the above objectives are outside the realm of writing about just what you know.

> “The only consistent way to keep writing is to keep learning, keep reading, and keep writing about that journey”

Most readers discover new topics to read and come to platforms like Medium to broaden their understanding on that.

For example Medium had well in excess of 60 Million visitors, people spending 5 Million+ hours collectively on the platform gobbling up content.

If you want to keep up with this and generate content that helps others it is crucial to (a) start reading new topics, and (b) write about your analysis and understanding on the topic because there will always be people who follow behind you on the discovery curve in discovering and wanting to read about a particular topic.

#### ***Contrary*** to what people might say about writing being a ***single person skill*** I believe that it relies a lot on your ***network centric*** skills.

People usually picture writers sitting in a room tapping away at their computers spinning up content all by themselves.

While this picture is probably accurate, it is crucial to realize that there is a tremendous amount of interaction with other people, writers etc which is needed before locking yourself away in a room to write.

Meeting people, speaking to people contributes to one important thing more than anything else — ***builds clarity of thought*** which helps tremendously before you start writing anything.

For short form content like Medium publications, meeting people also gives you a very good understanding of how your content will be received by you potential readers.

I have realized that unique perspectives are generated at intersections of skills/roles/expectations/demographics.

*How does a designer look at a programmer? What do Development teams and Sales teams think about each other?*

If these intersections give those unique perspectives, as a writer you need to stand at those intersections. Only way to do that is to meet people across a range of skills/roles/expectations/demographics and gather them.

The more interactions you end up meeting people at will hopefully give you excellent ideas and thoughts to keep writing. Doing this puts you in the realm of writing how others are influencing your knowledge / ideas and thoughts which is a much richer perspective than just yours.

> Writing is definitely a creative skill, but zeroing in “what to write” is a lot more structure and rigour.

#### Always read more than you ever write (including your drafts !)

Remember that there is always more content out there than you can ever assimilate. I believe that this fact should not hamper one’s writing interests in any way or form.

I think this is harder said than done. It is sometimes natural to get overwhelmed by reading all of relevant content on virtually any topic and just give up writing on that all together.

Every article out their is the writers perspective on the topic. I hope you believe this, but if you dont just try a simple experiment,

*   Take an article that you think interests you and is on a topic you have been following
*   Start reading it closely and try to see how you would have worded it if you were writing it.
*   Words / Structure / Content will all evolve as you do it.

You just brought your perspective on a topic which might have changed a lot of the messages that some other writer wrote about.

Avoiding getting overwhelmed by the millions of articles that already exist today is not easy, but hopefully these thoughts will keep you motivated to write and write consistently.

*   You are definitely writing content for others to consume, but this has a tremendous impact on you as an individual. Don’t discount that completely.
*   Yes there is enough and more content out there on virtually any topic under the sun. Remember that discovery of relevant content is never complete and there will always be people who are looking for content on a topic after you.
*   Even if you are writing on the same topic as somebody else, it will always carry your unique stamp of writing on it.

***As you read more and more content — meet more and more people across multiple intersections you will definitely build content that will add value to people.***
