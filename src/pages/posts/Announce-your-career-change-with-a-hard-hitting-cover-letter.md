A lot of people keep going about their jobs without the will nor motivation to challenge status-quo even if they want to.

It is hard ! if you have taken it upon yourself to challenge it feel good about it and congratulate yourself 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

You have put the much needed efforts and 6–8 months later feel prepared to take on the world from your new vantage point.

***But there is one more hurdle to cross…***

You are not in a group of qualified people vying for the same set of opportunities. As is always the case, the key is to “stand-out” of the crowd and make sure you are noticed.

Is not easy, but with a few suggestions below, am hoping to get your creative juices flowing. Keen to hear your thoughts and suggestions as always.

> **Remember you are making a change and it is imperative that you explain yourself right at the very beginning**

I think the best idea would be to start your cover letter / resume giving a glimpse of your journey in the last months / years you have been navigating this career change.

Any recruiter who looks at your CV will want to know why you are changing careers, what your motivations are among a number of other things. It is best to put these questions and doubts in a recruiters mind to rest sooner than later.

> **As I discovered it is best if you can “Keep it personal, keep it honest and keep it to the point”**

A possible example note below — but remember that every career journey is unique and it is super critical that you spend time and energy in bringing out your own journey.

> **…start with some initial introductions of the role you are applying, how you found it and so on…**

> 20 months ago, I was on one of my usual business trips waiting for my return flight back home. As my luck would have it, flight was delayed multiple times and finally cancelled. I got talking to another frequent traveller, and conversation quickly got into how happy or unhappy we were at our jobs. He had been doing the job for much longer than me and expressed that it was much harder for him to actually make a career change at this stage.

> This chance conversation got me thinking and felt that I should probably explore what else is possible when I probably could. Was there something else that I would rather be doing than what I was doing today?

> Challenging status-quo is never easy and a couple of months passed without any real movement. But everytime I started thinking — getting back to coding was one thought that stood out and I kept dabbling with possibilities around that as I went on with my day job.

> It was not a east start by any means, but after a few false starts my motivation got me going and soon I was hooked onto learning a range of web technologies.

> Once I was hooked on to learning new technologies, there was no looking back. Spent time on learning React, Javascript, NodeJS, Firebase/Firestore, Authentication, NoSQL, AWS and Azure, Serverless and many many other technology areas.

> I spent almost all my free time, evenings, weekends, to the point when it started becoming an obsession to get through as much as possible in a day. I realized that learning anything is about putting in the needed hours ([“10,000-Hour Rule”](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_%28book%29)) to become adept at anything. If I had to have any chance of getting good at programming, I realized that consistency is key. Since then I have kept to a schedule of spending 2–4 hours every day and keep the progress going and this consistency has been super helpful for me.

> While getting through tutorials was useful in the beginning, I also learnt that working towards realizing an idea was advantageous in so many ways. I started imagining my learning as a journey towards realizing a “startup idea” and that created wonders.

> I learnt so many of other elements which I probably would not have if I had not take this approach— working towards an MVP, presenting your developments, building a portfolio, networking with others to support your initiatives, managing dev/staging/prod environments and many more.

> I am also a strong believer in the idea of transferable assets from my past career as a strong positive in addition the technologies that I have mastered recently. I would like to call upon one which I think will add the maximum value in my second career — my strong network and relationships that I have built and nurtured over the years.

> I have built a strong network of over a 1000 contacts, spread across 46 organizations from startups to large organizations, covering a broad spectrum of roles in 15+ countries. Diving deeper into this list, there are a number of potential customers, suppliers, market leaders, market advisors and others whom I can hopefully leverage at the right time to further the market goals of your esteemed firm.

> As you would also imagine, any references you would look forward to would be largely from my past career, but will make it worth your while to speak to them and get a good view of my strengths and assets as relevant to the role I am applying for.

> A further detailed view of my technical capabilities and portfolio projects are detailed below.

> Looking forward to hear from you and hope to have an opportunity at your firm.

> **…wrap up the letter here…**

I hope this sample cover letter has give you some ideas of how you can frame yours. But as I said at the outset, each journey is personal and it is important that you ***“Keep it personal, keep it honest and keep it to the point”***

Remember a career change is about doing what you love. You never know where you will end unless your start.
