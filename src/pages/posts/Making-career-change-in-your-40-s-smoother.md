You are in your 40’s and have had a successful career behind you and you probably have made even good progress by climbing up the career ladder.

By now, you have spent years upon years on building a successful career journey where you probably have opportunities to,

*   Have your work recognized by your company
*   Travel the world on your job and overcame the fear of flying
*   Mentor a great team and attended weddings in 4 different countries
*   Develop a great product that impacts people’s lives
*   Build a quality of life cushion for your family
*   …

You dont like what you are doing any more, and want to explore opportunities outside. Or maybe, you have realized you actually can’t more any further and, in spite of the fact that you do like your career, you don’t want to get stuck in a dead end.

Either ways you want to see options you have available to you to change career paths. You are not alone in your thought process.

Making a decision is definitely is hard, but no harder than it would have been at other time in your career.

When you contemplate a change in your 40’s, the biggest fear you will need to overcome is the ***impact that changing status quo will have on you and your life and your family.***

> **“It’s only after you’ve stepped outside your comfort zone, your status-quo that you begin to change, grow”**

***…but you already knew all of that…***

#### Think Positively

Don’t underestimate the impact of the change you are beginning to undertake. Positive thinking and optimism are key to get you past the change.

Relearning anything at 40 can feel daunting, but you know by now how you learn best. Are evening best for you to work on your career path? Work with a team that can push you on? More the hands-on type — work on a project? Make sure you use that to you advantage.

If you are planning to retire, as many people do, at 60 or 65, you still have more than 2 decades of work on your new career path. At the satisfaction that you are doing something you like / have made a conscious choice is with you and this should help your positive thinking.

*Keep focus on the end goal you have in mind with this career changes. Whatever it is — make sure that visualise that thing — or feeling –and it’ll help you achieve it.*

#### Get your family and friends on your side

Before you go too far with evaluating this change remember that at this stage it is no longer just the impact on you as an individual.

Change will affect your family and friends around you equally. You probably you have children who are financially dependent on you, you have a mortgage that you need to pay, you have a certain lifestyle that you have been accustomed to can’t change easily.

*All this means one thing — have your family and friends included in your choice for the next career.*

*   More people evaluating pros and cons — healthy amount of deliberation is always good. Just keep it balanced, you definitely dont want analysis paralysis.
*   Discuss only with people who matter. Discussing wtih your partner is a must, children if they are old enough but everybody else is optional.
*   Focus on how the change you are contemplating in as objective terms as possible. Don’t keep either a very pessimistic or overly optimistic view — balance is key.

#### Have a plan and also a backup plan

Plan to changes — oh yes ! it is important but am pretty sure you would do that and do it well.

My own personal experience is what is more important is to ensure that you have worked out two additional things

***Always have a backup plan***

*   What possible pivots can you think of to make your move more effective
*   Can you come back to your current job if things dont go as per plan — evaluate things like a sabbatical for example.
*   Can you work out a side hustle which can keep your going which you work on the main plan?

***When to accept your plan did not work and get out***

All positive thinking and hard work are important but the hardest thing in my mind is to know when to give up.

While it is a good thing to probably make a career change, is not a great thing to keep it going even when you know things are not going as per plan. Activate your backup plans quickly and try your best to iterate your career change in as agile a manner as possible.

Despite that if things dont work — dont let your ego come in the way of accepting that your efforts were not successful and pivot or even go back at the right time.

#### Change is hard, but remember you have a time to activate your career move and build another successful innings around that.

#### Plan for it, work smart, carry your [transferable assets](https://medium.com/career-reinvent/switching-careers-dont-leave-your-assets-behind-52b52003078f) forward, get your family and friends to support you and get it done !
