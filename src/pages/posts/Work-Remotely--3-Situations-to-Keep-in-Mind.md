Working Remotely is no longer just a trend, but more and more companies are recognising the value of this. To pick a few lines from a [article](https://medium.com/swlh/should-tech-companies-offer-employee-de-location-packages-a4f2b3b3e27f) I read today,

> In the age of remote work, companies with workplace flexibility will attract the best employees in the world and keep them. They’ll also save money. Nearly half of the companies polled in a recent [remote work study](http://www.condecosoftware.com/resources-hub/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2019/05/Condeco-workplace-report-2019-Digital-Copy.pdf) reported that offering remote work helps them lower their operating costs and scale their workforce. Flexibility is in such high demand that [Entrepreneur](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/331957) decided it shouldn’t be labeled as a “job perk” anymore.

To catch up with this trend there are any number of articles on Medium and elsewhere which talk about things around how to achieve “**Effective Remote Working**”.

Am sure these articles are key, but looking back at the 10+ years that I have been working remotely (70%+ of my time) myself, I think there are situations when Remote Working does not simply just fit or needs a lot more effort and planning to remain effective.

I definitely understand that there are any number of types of “remote workers” with varying situations to contend with.

*   You have an office, but are allowed to work remotely 5 days a week as part of your arrangement at work.
*   You have an office which is relatively far and you prefer to save time commuting and work from home.
*   Most of your development teams are in a near-shore or off-shore location and your employer just does not want to spend money on travels etc.
*   You are part of a virtual team where the rest of the team are all remotely working as well
*   You are simply an individual contributor working remotely — for example you are a programmer or a writer or …
*   You have negotiated a work from home contract to support your personal situation, but rest of your team is working from office at a certain physical location.

Each person’s situation is unique and your perspective to look at the situations I am about to describe would be different as well.

But as always this is a start and am keen to hear from others around this topic.

#### Do you feel like you have less work and more spare time?

In my personal experience, remote working is ideal when you have enough and more work to keep your fully busy. In that situation a lot of ensuring that remote working is effective is about “self discipline”. I usually focused on the four simple things when I was in such a situation,

*   Keep to a schedule — Start and Stop at regular times
*   Always Plan / Schedule conversations with the rest of the team — Video calls are even better.
*   Don’t work in your Pyjamas — I am using this statement to undoubtedly cover all elements of bringing structure to your work.
*   Take a break away from home — run an errand, hit the gym or anything that can get you out of the house at some point.

***Everybody has phases when you seem to have more free time and work is less. As a remote worker, I think these are the periods of time that need much more structure and planning to keep things effective.***

Keeping to the 4 simple rules when you have more free time is much harder than you might think.

> “Managing to complete all your tasks when you have a shortage of time is easier than when you have too much of it”

Not all remote workers might have the possibility to balance the % of time you work remotely, but my strong suggestion is if you can reduce the % — do it and go more into the office.

But if you cant — then try to evaluate a few of these suggestions as applicable to you. Working at home makes it a lot harder to not “relax” but get into something to make use of the lean period, but that is where your self discipline come into play.

*   **Go out and meet more people** — use the free time which you have to do something which you normally could not do. Meeting your broader team, suppliers, friends physically is always a great thing. Invest the time to build a connect with people you usually always work virtually with. Trust me it is a investment which is well worth it.
*   **Sign yourself up for trainings / certifications** — no role is static and things are changing around almost every role. If you can attend any certifications, trainings in this period — invest in upgrading yourself.
*   **Do what you never had time to do** — Have you had an idea you wanted to always work on? Contribute to a specific charity? Write on Medium may be — paucity of time was always your constraint, but with that not being a challenge it is just you needing to make up your mind.
*   **Keep to a schedule** — When you have less work and you are working from home naturally it is harder to keep to a schedule. If you think you don’t need to put it 8 hours but may 4 or 6 hours is fine, it is perfectly ok but keep to that schedule.

#### Holidays = Better Planning

Be it long summer breaks or one of the many mid term breaks it is a no brainer that it is a great advantage if you can work from home. It gives you an opportunity to spend more time with kids, get more done around the home and so on.

But ask any long time remote worker and they will tell you that it is exactly why you need to plan better to ensure that you don’t miss on your expected outcomes on the work front as well.

A few suggestions to handle this,

*   **Prepare a plan for what you intend to do with the kids and when** — Do you intend to teach them cycling or take them swimming, go camping, read a book series, teach programming or any of the other 101 things? Great ! Plan for it and don’t just assume that since there is a lot of time it will get done.
*   **Block off office times , anything you can do late evenings —** Am pretty sure there are things that you need to get done during the work day. Block sufficient time to get this done. Showing outcomes as a remote worker is more important. If you have the flexibility to work later at night and complete you tasks take every opportunity to do that.
*   **Take a holiday** — While you might think that you have been with the kids during the entire holidays, there is nothing like a taking a complete break. Definitely do that.

#### Are you finding it harder to demonstrate outputs?

In almost every job today what matters is the ability to show outputs. While it is the same for remote workers as well, since people may not be “seeing” you work hard for achieving the outcomes.

If you are working remotely, but for some reason you are unable to demonstrate the outcomes— *unable to checkin code if you are a programmer, unable to get designs that interest people if you are a designer, unable to fix issues at the pace you are expected if you are supporting, unable to close deals if you are a sales person, slower than expected rate of turning in content if you are a content writer* — you need to definitely change a few things to avoid getting into a challenging situation.

A few things that I have done in situations like this,

*   **Communicate Excessivel**y — Are you somebody who rather lets your results speak for you? If you are not getting the results, adapt to make sure you communicate progress on a regular basis. Your team and manager need to know your efforts.
*   **Involve your Manager** — For example are you meeting prospects / customers regularly? Take your Manager with you? You might be missing something which your manager might pick.
*   **Talk to your Team** — You need to be careful if everybody on the team is finding things hard or is just you. Ensure that you talk to your team and colleagues and analyse this.
*   **Evaluate Remote Work Suitability** — You and your employer might have planned for an effective remote working scenario. If you are not able to deliver the outcomes make sure that you evaluate if remote working in hampering you in any way. If yes, see what you can do about it.

#### In closing,

If you are a remote worker — always introspect to see if any change is needed when you hit in one of the following situations,

*   You seem to have free time on hand after you have finished up what you are expected to do.
*   Working remotely during the holidays with everybody else at home
*   If you are consistently finding it harder to show outcomes to your manager and your team
