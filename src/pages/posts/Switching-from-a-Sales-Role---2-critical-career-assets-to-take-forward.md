If you are here you are probably changing your career? Hope the content here would help you.

> **DISCLAIMER** : If anybody tells you that changing careers is easy, believe me they are lying. It is damn hard.

Depending on the new role you are changing into there are loads of things to learn and a lot of unknowns facing you.

> Where do I start?

> Will I be successful in my change initiative?

> Am I right in doing this?

> Will I be able to build the financial stability my family needs?

> **…and probably a 100 other questions to which you dont know the answer to when you start off.**

However, if there is one thing that you can confidently rely on is anything that your current role has taught you over the years. These learnings are your assets to take forward and help you built an island of stability in sea of change.

As I was mentioning in another article titled [***“Switching Careers — dont leave your assets behind”***](https://medium.com/career-reinvent/switching-careers-dont-leave-your-assets-behind-52b52003078f)  each person's career assets are a unique combination of learnings across his specific career journey.

Having been involved in multiple IT roles roles over the last two decades, with last 10 years spent in multiple sales roles among the range of things, I think two important elements stand out for me.

### Relationships with technology partners, customers, suppliers, market influencers, advisors and so on…

As a sales person I have spent the maximum time building contacts and relationships across partners, customers, suppliers etc.

When you are contemplating a move in allied areas such as setting off on your own as a consultant, working as a founder / co-founder on a startup, sales coach/advisor etc. these relationships are simply priceless.

> As one of my managers used to say, **“Use your contacts carefully. Each relationship you build has a time and place when it can deliver the maximum value to you, and key is in identifying that right moment”**

As a Salesperson / manager you have relied on these relationships supported by the organization brand that you have been associated with. The relevance of the point above goes up exponentially when you try to leverage a relationship as an individual. Some relationships will simply be not as strong as you hoped it was, but nevertheless this is a strong tool in your toolbox.

While you are working on preparing for your next move, dont miss out on keeping the relationships warm and engaged.

Actively look for opportunities to connect with them, keep them involved in your journey — couple of examples…

*   For example if you start building and developing a concept as part of a startup, you might take 6–9 months before you have an MVP you feel is worth taking back to your network. While this is natural, use your network as a sounding board and let them guide you. This way you can actually go back to them at the right time to ask for a more active participation — seed fund your project / idea, trial it in their enterprise, introduce you to suppliers and so on.
*   Ask any startup founder if there is one thing that they die for is “market validation”. Market validation comes in multiple forms —does the idea hold merit, is my technology architecture optimum, have I picked the right set of features for my MVP, is my target market correct,what commercial model would suit best and so on. Look for opportunities to use your network validate your thoughts.

### Selling technology solutions in the market have helped build a good appreciation of what customers buy.

Having sold solutions in the market for a long time, I like to believe that I have been able to build an appreciation of what customers are looking for and what and when they are more likely to buy. I have some good list of criteria they might employ to make a critical comparison across their options.

Building this understanding of customer expectations does not come easy — it is the output of hours of effort spent in preparation for every customer pitch starting by dishing out all there is to offer on the platter and then whittling it down to the ***minimum sellable package.***

This is probably akin to what a startup founder would call a ***minimum viable product***, aiming to only develop what would potentially sell.

Ability to prioritize a list of what solutions are available for your to sell *(= range of feature possibilities around your idea in the startup world)* to a much smaller list of what will pass the customer criteria *(= where do we put the limited $$ and time a startup has at its disposal)* is a unique asset is critical to take forward.

Hope this was useful. Am keen to hear what you see as career assets either in a Sales Role or any other role you might be playing today.
