> Am I sure if I want to do be doing “this” for rest of my career?

> Can I change my career path in my 30’s, 40’s?

> Is it possible to get back to programming or music or whatever your first career love was?

> Will my job be the same in 5 or 10 years? Will it even exist?

If there were questions that were you were grappling with let me assure you it is quite common for a number of us. Needless to say, none of these questions have a “right” answer or even have an answer !

#### So what do you do with these questions? Ignore them and keep doing what you are doing or possibly fuel them further?

I would argue that while a large majority of the people keep doing what they are doing, learn to like what they are doing and get on with their . There however is a small percentage of people who build up enough courage and motivation in their minds to do something about answering questions such as these.

So if you made the effort to even think of taking this jump, it is already a success on many levels.

If you landed safely on the other side and your second career took off — Congratulations to you !

But dont despair even if it did not. Am sure you will agree this journey of change in itself has given you so many learnings.

#### Challenging Status-Quo

Initiating any form of change, let alone something as fundamental as a career change is super hard.

You did it ! Success already for you.

I think the ability to crystallize your thoughts to visualize the goals and objectives sufficiently to set you said on journey of change is super amazing. Coupled with the assumption that this change itself was not something that was a need for you, makes the setting of this journey of change even more special.

***Next time you have a doubt with goals / objectives — remember to trust yourself more than you did before today.***

#### Starting from ZERO is never easy

Just ask anybody who is finishing college and starting to find a job. With the umpteen number of possibilities and options, it is damn hard to just even make up your mind, and then get the right job. You had done that once and could have rested on that and let your career path take you forward.

But you ***choose*** not to. That says something about you.

As you advance in your career, expectations from family and friends keep moving up.

Your willingness to try to carry those (heavier) expectations and make a fresh start once again in a second career it is something that has for sure made you a tougher person.

#### Learning anything new never goes waste

You choose programming as your second career. You spend hours and hours of you evenings and weekends learning new technologies, build projects and present it to people. While you were doing all of this the only thing that kept you going was the clarity of thought of the change you wanted to make to your career.

But despite your best effort, the dream job you wanted has eluded you so far. Recruiters have not bought you [journey](https://medium.com/career-reinvent/announce-your-career-change-resume-with-a-hard-hitting-cover-letter-2710567e0b0a) as you thought they would.

This can happen to anybody, but it is not the end of the road.

Pivoting to meet the situation in front of you is a life skill that you will never regret picking up.

#### In closing,

If you are questioning your current career and you have the courage to embark on a possible career change journey — you have tasted success. You have a lot of learnings you can take with you from the effort itself.

Ofcourse, one measure of success is if you can actually make the career change you hoped to make when you started off.
