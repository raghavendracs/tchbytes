As you rack up years on your career, have you ever got the feeling that you stopped doing the thing you love and start managing a set of people who do the thing you loved.

> You loved meeting people, selling them your ideas and solutions, feel the rush of them buying your pitch — but you are now a Sales Manager who spends half your time helping people do what you loved dearly.

> You loved Programming, learning and trying new technologies, framework— but spend more time now managing people who actually code

> Testing to break software was your thing — but now you spend more time tracking if others are doing a good job at it.

Look around and you will find excellent justifications as to why somebody should be actually making moves like these. For years and years you did not find this a problem and there probably isn’t any.

*You can add more value as your sphere of influence increases, you need to mentor others to actually get better as well, doing the same thing does not earn you more $$ but managing people who do it gets you there.*

Whatever it is you started doing in your career, the farther and farther you move away from doing that thing which you loved and enjoyed, there is the chance you miss it and probably want to get back to it.

#### Individual Contributor (starting again!)

After having done years of “managing” people most of us forget one simple fact — if you want to start a alternate career you are starting fresh so you first need to learn and do the thing before anything else.

If you have been a manager in your past life, unlearning to “manage” others is not a easy thing to do. You have been managing people, supporting them, guiding them to learn and do things that you have forgotten the feeling to learn something which you should do by yourself.

What is it like being an ***Individual Contributor ?***

Simply put this means it is a position of ownership, that you will not have a team behind you to turn to. You are now back to being a team of ONE, you will get a responsibility and you have to own it completely.

#### Managing Yourself (not others!)

Getting to being an Individual Contributor is part learning the skill you are aiming to, but part learning to manage yourself. If you have been a manager, the thing that you will start realizing is managing yourself is much harder than managing others.

Managing others’ time utilization, learning, shortfalls is simply about telling them while the hard work of actually working on that rests with the recipient.

Moment you start looking inwards, you naturally cut more slack for yourself, give bigger margins for error, rationalize why you could not achieve something more effectively.

Two things that will help you most are probably,

*   Get somebody who can “manage” your progress — looking for a mentor can quicken your learning multifold, but finding one is hard.
*   Get a team to work with — you more than anybody else knows that is easier for others to hold mirrors at you rather than seeing your errors yourself.

#### Hope this short article gets you on the way to driving your career change effectively.
