Among all suggestions that you make — 20 comments and using up daily quota of claps stood out for me.

You highlight correctly that it takes time to make that 20 comments every day (coincidentally it is my 3rd today), but a few suggestions to quicken that and potentially get good value as well.

1.  Everybody I know on Medium reads articles across a range of topics. Comment on articles you read on **a particular topic** everyday. Your comments and ideas can build on top of each other and making the 20 comments can go faster.
2.  You read a particular article and feel like you have a lot of comments, but stick to the top most point to comment. People dont read long articles and even less read the responses.
