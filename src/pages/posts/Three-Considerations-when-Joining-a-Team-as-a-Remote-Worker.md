There are any number of articles that you can Google to get the list of benefits that remote working can bring to the party. Having been working remotely myself for last many years I can only agree to the advantages wholeheartedly.

Technology advances are striving hard to keep pace at making virtual teams more effective which is driving a virtuous cycle even further.

As with anything great, there are a few things to keep in mind to get better value from remote working and virtual teams as well.

I believe that the elements to keep in mind are dependent on a number of factors,

*   What stage of your career are you on?
*   Is the company in a transition phase from office to virtual?
*   Are you starting off in a company as a virtual team member?
*   What stage of life are you in? Single? Married? With kids?
*   What role are you playing? Individual Contributor? Team Manager?

In this specific article I am focusing on the following scenario,

> “You are joining a company which has large teams that are office based. They have realised that if they need to attract strong talent like yours they need to offer a remote working option. They did offer that for this role which you have been selected.

> It was one of the biggest aspects that attracted you to this role as it gives you the much needed flexibility as you and your partner have just had your second kid.

> You are looking forward to remotely join this team and contribute to the best possible”.

I think there are at least three areas that you should pay special attention to while you take up remote working in this context.

**Completeness of Business Context**

Business Context is not something which can be gathered by presentations and formal material on the company website. Am sure your new company will run initiatives for remote employees such as yourself to be on-boarded, but if you dont form a majority of their workforce, these efforts will only give you part of the context. They would hope you will put the needed effort to cover the rest.

As things are today in most organisations, the business context is a perspective that you build for yourself by ***speaking*** to as many people as possible — *colleagues, team members, support staff, business teams, management*.

As somebody who is starting off new in this company, the onus is on \*YOU\* is to seek people to speak to and gather this information.

Be absolutely sure nobody else will ping you on Slack or Skype you at home and offer to share the information with you. Nobody simply has the time to do this.

While you have all the skills needed for the job you have been hired for, you need to remember that it is the business context that can help you adapt that to make it more beneficial for both yourself and the company.

#### Understanding of the Company Culture

> At the risk of sounding cliche, let me throw a high sounding definition out there in the fray — “**Company Culture is the character and personality of the team and organisation you are beginning to work for”.**

Is understanding of the culture critical for you to operate at optimal levels — I think the answer is a definite yes !

Put in much simpler terms, culture is what makes your team and company unique and is the sum of all things which can be categorised as ways of working — interactions, rules, guidelines, principles and so on and so forth.

Imagine having to gather all this working remotely from Day 1 amidst a new team, new company where you only talk to people when you need to and more so do it remotely. It is hard !

Supporters of remote working thinking must be thinking “*Video Conversations, Presence Indicators and the likes can help you get over of this easily”*

I don’t disagree at all with any of that. Technology advances are wonderful and will surely make it all easier. My only contention is the benefit case does not stack up for immediate remote working when you are starting in a new company and beginning your understanding of the team from ZERO.

Give it a few weeks, months and then you will have a handle on both the team and company culture. At this point remote interactions will seem okay and then hopefully get better as well.

#### Working as a team

Am sure you will agree when I say that teams are what makes companies great.

> “No one can whistle a symphony. It takes a whole orchestra to play it.” — H.E. Luccock

There are any number of articles and content which speaks about how teams and teamwork is nurtured. I will absolutely not get into that here, other than saying that it needs participation and involvement of the team outside the remote working context to get optimum results.

Having been part of multiple remote teams myself, it is clear to me, as long as you work as a team by sharing a physical space together for a period of time (*different teams might need varying periods of time*), you can move into a remote working mode post that.

> You could use a simple metric to discover the right timing when a team is ready to move in a complete remote way of working — **“Can you list 10 things about each member on your inner team that is not listed on their resume, is not work related?”**

Knowing more about your team members is a tremendous booster for team work and can do wonders. Invest the time to do this when you are starting off as part of any new team as it simply gets tougher to do this in a remote working context.

#### In closing…

You have probably landed a job which allows you to work remotely 100% of the time and you feel that you have a great opportunity that suits you current situation extremely well.

Take care of the three areas below and you will set yourself up for success.

> Spend the time needed at office to ensure you have the business context. You need to appreciate key asks from the business, goals and vision before you can adapt yourself to perform in an optimum manner.

> Spend the time needed at office to ensure you understand enough about the company culture and more importantly how the team that you are going to be part of operates.

> You might have an individual role, but it is always part of a team. Get to know team well before moving to a virtual working.

There is no saying how much time this will take, but dont be fooled into being able to crunch this into 2–3 days.

Feel free to adapt an approach that works for you, but definitely spend the needed time and energy on addressing these points.

Enjoy your work life as a Digital Nomad !
