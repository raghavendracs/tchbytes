If you are starting off to build your career in coding or you are switching careers to get into coding, be rest assured that somewhere along this journey people have been confronted with,

> Forced to start — stop efforts because things appeared too hard?

> Crippled with the feeling that the initial bump of entry is too hard to cross?

> Lost interest in getting passed tutorial after tutorial?

> Wasted effort night after night into learning with nothing much output to show?

> Get caught in rabbit holes of learning sometimes with no reason or need?

Adopting a ***“work harder and things will get better”*** approach here is hardly the best approach. While, hard work is key, but I think there just needs to be a more fundamental and sure shot way of confidently tackling these questions / situations.

> *As one of my early mentors told me*

> ***“Whatever your reasons are to getting into coding, if it is already not the case, just imagine that your end goal is to realize a startup idea — this single thought simplifies a whole lot of things and helps you make otherwise time consuming choices in a jiffy”***

Unless you already have a guaranteed job waiting you after your “training and learning”, I believe that this suggestion makes a lot of sense. But, I can surely hear some of you going in your mind like — ***“this is absolutely nuts ! why would I make life complex with assuming something like this”***

Let me summarize on the benefits list in that conversation, before you settle on one side or the other. Either way am keen to know you thoughts on why you might disagree. But first read on before you start…

#### Technology and Architecture choices seem simpler

Imagine you have no *startup idea* that you are working to build.

How do you make the choice of what Programming Language to learn? Which JavaScript or Python Framework to learn? Which Cloud Platform do you host your application on when time is right? Which database is best? What auth approach should I use? and so on….

You have no choice but to consult the research that others have done and also pick one of the conclusions they arrived at. Is it optimal — probably not, but it can give you the start you need.

If however you did have a *startup idea* to build,

You would definitely still have to read the analysis and learnings from those 10 articles that others wrote about, but using that you can decide the way forward depending on what choices suit the startup idea you are aiming to realize.

Agreed your idea might change and evolve, but it is part of the learning to be able to make and evolve the technology and architecture choices that suit the objective.

#### Embrace Constraints — they exist everywhere !

Every startup by definition is constrained for any number of factors (money, time, people, customers, competition and so on….).

When you look at the journey you are embarking on it is no different. One of the biggest constraints that you working under is the challenge of ***“you dont know what you dont know”.***

If this is a given, the safest approach is probably to start with “***what you know you know”*** (*thanks to all the learning material you have been going through and acing the assignment and sample projects*).

Remember we are working under the premise that you are building towards a *startup idea —* which in some sense means you have at least invested sometime in laying out a view of what you are hoping to build. Let us for simplicity sake assume this is a list of features categorized as must have features and optional features.

*   Starting with things you know build the features you can build— on a web application for example it would be all basic screens with no link between each other, no link to database, no ability to deploy into dev / prod and so on.
*   Iteratively look at the list of things you want to build and evaluate what you need to know to build that feature or option into your application. Say for example you want to build “authentication” into your application. Timebox your efforts to learn about the things you probably need to know to build this feature and go off to build it into your startup idea.

#### You can always find you way back on track

I am kind of hoping that nobody will disagree with the notion that it is critical to stay on track as you learn and build up your body of knowledge to make a successful start in your coding career.

With every area you start learning you can either stay at a very superficial level and not even scratch the surface or dig deeper and deeper and soon get lost in a rabbit hole.Believe me sometimes going deeper happens unconsciously without you even realizing this. This can cause you so much of lost time only to realize at the end that it was probably something that could have been avoided.

Having a feature set to guide you lets you choose the battles carefully. It helps you avoid some rabbit holes because there may be no feature for which that is needed. However should you get into one it might offer you some solace that you are burrowing in with some sense of purpose to build a feature.

Time saved is time gained to start your coding career sooner.

Hopefully you are convinced that it is better to have a startup idea to be the goal you are working to anchor your learning better.

If the idea you start working with actually does see the light of day — what better icing on the cake, than having a portfolio to demonstrate.

Feel free to comment critically if you see something not making any sense for you.
