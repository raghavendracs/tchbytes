The age-old debate of hunters vs farmers in Sales teams has faced a lot of analysis from a number of perspectives.

Am reasonably sure we don’t need another definition here, but will just summarise it for sake of completeness anyways.

> **Hunters** are typically people whose primary focus is to get as many new customers in the door as possible. They often focus on new leads, aim to convert them into customers. They are usually keen to explore new areas, markets in pursuit of deals.

> **Farmers (Account Managers)** spend most of their energy in developing long-term customer relationships working with customer teams, own delivery teams, partner teams and the like. They are usually keen to sustain long term partnerships and keen to work with a smaller set of customers.

Any Sales Organisation would obviously need both, but there is always a challenge in organising teams to ensure a delicate balance between personalities who tend to be farmers and those who tend to be hunters.

Just one look at the simple definitions above should give you an idea that hunters and farmers operate at different ends of the spectrum and have traditionally had completely different drivers.

But in today’s complex environment, the (relatively more) successful ones are the people who appreciate the importance of being well rounded. Hunters who know how to farm, and farmers who know how to hunt are rare but a great to have on any team.

There are a number of broad changes in technology sourcing that are making this crossover between hunters and farmers more critical and important. I have tried to cover 3 of them which I think are most important.

#### Bet and Bet Big, Start again if you lose

Starting from scratch and investing a lot of time in developing a pursuit is something that hunters will specialize in. After hunters love the chance to take the risk and enjoy the thrill of landing a new client by securing a deal. Ultimately, to a hunter, the pay-off at the end makes all the hard work worth it.

When the large multi-year outsourcing contracts were main stay, hunters cracked a customer and that customer usually stayed on for the long haul . Farmers did not have to worry about placing big bets in that customer context immediately. They could potentially build relationships and grow and scale the account by sustaining what was sold and then adding new services around it.

In the recent years as a number of trends (primarily Cloud and Digital) have been consistently pushing changes across the board which are changing the landscape of sourcing and deal making.

Customer and Buyers getting much more mature and are preparing better to address these changes. They have started sourcing for smaller and shorter deals which changes the dynamics of how hunters’ and farmers’ perspective on deals.

As a farmer who has been building a successful relationship with the customers, there are a few things that you need to watch out for.

*   Competition is always knocking on the doors of customers in unique and creative ways to reshape the current agreement a customer might have with you. Customer are much more receptive to these requests which forces account managers to think differently.
*   Customers are building in hooks in contracts to carve out specific elements of work to enable them take advantage of new and innovative offerings that are brought to them.

All this automatically means that account managers need to borrow a leaf from the hunters portfolio and be always ready to place big bets in reshaping contracts, or sometime even parts of it on an ongoing basis.

> *“Effectively a farmer needs to hunt in an existing relationship or risk being hunted out”*

#### Redefining “no” for both Hunters and Farmers

It is common knowledge and even an expectation that anybody Sales is always ready to hear a “no”. Irrespective of how good one is, being able to handle a “no” is extremely critical for any sales person.

From a hunter's perspective a “no” used to mean that a large deal had been taken away from the table for 5 or 7 years. The next chance of getting that customer back depended on how the winning party performed and when the deal came back to the table. This meant there was no merit in sitting around and waiting around this specific prospect.

But all the same reasons that I spoke in previously — *deals getting shorter, smaller, high propensity of customer to reshape deals in deal tenure* means that hunters are better off farming these customers even when answer on a deal is a “no”.

Clearly it appears that hunters need to borrow a lesson or two from farmers in building relationships for the long run.

Farmers after all always built most of their business growth using a strong focus on relationship based selling. As customer propensity to reshape deals increases, the possibility and chance of hearing a “no” increases substantially as well.

The insulated environment of a holding on to a customer for the deal term is no longer available to them taking away the implicit “right for first refusal” they had in existing customer scenarios.

#### Is your Organisation Hunting or Farming today?

In my personal experience every organisation has its strengths (hunters or farmers) and typically they tend to organise the teams of hunters and farmers around those.

Firms which have hunting as their stronger competence emphasize internally on farming once in 12–18 months whereas firms which have farming as their stronger area emphasize the other way round.

***I think organizations needs to seriously rethink this strategy. As we have seen above already, hunters and farmers are more than ever needing to develop each others traits to remain successful.***

Organisations need to support Hunters and Farmers to work more closely than they have ever done before to ensure that they are better prepared to address the circle of change which is developing at a aggressive pace.

*   Customers plan for and have the opportunity to look for options to reshape contracts.
*   Driven by Technology Advances and heightened Innovation, potentially faster and nimbler competitors to the incumbent are putting options in front of customers motivating them to think change.
*   As these changes look attractive and achievable, customers are making and breaking relationships with suppliers quicker.

If the premise that we started off with is true — each organisation either has hunting as it core focus or farming as its core focus, bringing a change to make sure these both on par is not going to be a easy journey, but one that can’t be avoided.

#### ***In Summary…***

*I think I have presented a case for you to be convinced that having separate hunting and farming personas might not be the most optimal way to create high performing Sales Teams.*

*As individuals, emphasis on hunters and farmers to build traits that were traditionally considered the stronghold of the other is a absolute must to remain successful as a Sales person in the market today.*
