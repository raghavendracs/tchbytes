Are you speaking about how you would rather be doing something else than what you are doing today whenever you have a chance to speak to people?

There might be a chance that you want to change your career. But there definitely are at least 3 if’s you want to validate to make sure you don’t jump to conclusions too soon.

Once you have your answers ready that is something you rather discuss with people who matter to have a great path ahead.

After all, getting clarity of thought that you indeed want to change is in my mind half the battle won already.

#### Job Role or Team- what is motivating your change?

In my experience a very interesting job can become boring if you are amidst a wrong team, or could be the other way around, an otherwise boring job can excite you in the company of the right team.

It is extremely important to introspect a little to see what exactly triggered the change you are seeking to make.

> *QUESTION #1 : What is pushing you to question status quo and consider a career change — Is it the job or is it your team, company and other factors?*

Remember you spent a whole lot of time in building the career that you are in and before you go about changing it drastically you need to be sure that you want to do it.

While I know you can never be completely sure, you owe it to all your efforts thus far in your current career to try changing elements of your career — your team, your company, your role, your location.

***“Come on man ! trying all this take a lot of time, and is not even easy to accomplish. If I take it upon myself to try all this before making a career change, I might never do it.”***

Yes definitely this would take time, but so does building an alternate career.

Who ever led you to believe it is easy to learn a new skill and top it off with finding a new job based on that?

All I am asking you to remember is consider smaller changes as possible options too. At the end what you are looking for is to be happy at whatever you do in your career.

#### Are you uncomfortable with you current career situation or what you see the future looks like?

As you look analyse your own career journey, you need to consider the path you have taken to get here and path forward that you see for yourself.

A lot of decisions have got you to where you are, some which you planned for and some which you were forced into. Each of these decision points, led you to adapt and propel your career forward.

> QUESTION #2 : Is it your current career situation or the future that you see for yourself if you stick to this career path?

If you are happy in your current career situation, but uncomfortable with what career path you see for yourself — relax a little, as you definitely have more options to evaluate. You have the chance to influence the future path to what you want to achieve, for example,

*   If you think that the career trajectory is too slow for you, you might for example want to explore making the effort to get an additional degree rather than starting off something completely different.
*   Are you in a huge company which does not see to give you sufficient alternatives? Explore a smaller / niche company?
*   Are you in a small branch office — would moving to your company HQ be a possibility? will it help?
*   …

### Can a side hustle be what you are missing?

You have had a busy career and have been devoting 100% of your time towards that. You have the results to reflect all that energy and effort you have put into your career.

> QUESTION #3 : Despite all your efforts on your current career, are you at a point in your career where you will look back and feel like you have could have done more? Is this driving you to change your career path?

After all this expression of “yeh dil maange more!” (the heart wants more) is what separates achievers from the others. When you have this feeling, it is important to not confuse this with your need to change careers.

It is time to keep to what you are doing and see how you can enhance that further. Start doing anything which can give you satisfaction — write, learn programming, give back to communities, support seniors. It is never late to start and never difficult to find time to do things you like.

Developing a second interest in parallel with your current job has tremendous benefits,

*   Gives you an avenue to do all that you can’t do at work. For example if you start writing, you can reach and influence a whole new group of people you would have otherwise never have interacted with.
*   Work with a team that you can build — build a project for charity or cause if you are the technical type — learn programming you need to.
*   While this is a side hustle, ensure that you build some consistency into this. It is critical that you don’t fritter away starts only to hit the roadblock in a year’s time feeling that you have not done enough with your career.
*   …

Focusing on a hobby can potentially get you feeling good again, and thereby getting back into the stride on your main career.

#### Conclusion

So before you go about changing your career path drastically ask the following 3 important questions.

***QUESTION #1 : What is pushing you to question status quo and consider a career change — Is it the job or is it your team, company and other factors?***

***QUESTION #2 : Is it your current career situation or the future that you see for yourself if you stick to this career path?***

***QUESTION #3 : Despite all your efforts on your current career, are you at a point in your career where you will look back and feel like you have could have done more? Is this driving you to change your career path?***

Once you have spent time and energy in finding answers to these 3 critical questions, you are firm footing on any path you decide to take forward.
